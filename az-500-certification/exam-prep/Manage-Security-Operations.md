## 4.1 Plan, Implement, and Manage Governance for Security

- **Create, Assign, and Interpret Security Policies and Initiatives in Azure Policy**
  - "Control how people create resources in Azure"
    - Azure Policy does both governance _and_ security
  - "A policy is a setting"
    - E.g. (you) can only deploy VMs to UK South / a VM can only be a certain SKU / and so forth
  - "An initiative is a collection of policy settings"
    - E.g. (you could create one called) "VM Creation Initiative"
  - Use the built-in _security policy_ definitions
    - _Or_ create custom ones
  - Create in the ARM Portal via the "Security policy" page
  - To assign policies use Portal / PowerShell / Azure CLI
  - The default initiative automatically assigned to every subscription in Defender for Cloud is the _MS Cloud Security Benchmark_
  - Recommendations are displayed on the "recommendations" page _if_ (your) environment doesn't follow the policies!

- **Configure Security Settings by Using Azure Blueprints**
  - "All about deploying resources for a _subscription_"
  - The following resources are supported as artifacts inside a blueprint
    - 1 - Resource Groups
    - 2 - ARM Template
    - 3 - Policy Assignment
      - NOTE: This is _security related_!
    - 4 - Role Assignment
      - NOTE: This is _security related_!
  - Can use a blueprint for a new subscription _or_ to modify an existing subscription

- **Deploy Security by Using a Landing Zone**
  - "...talking about _migration_ environments"
  - "A secure landing zone means security controls are in place _before_ resources are deployed"
    - "Plan with security in mind"
  - Adopt IaC + integrate security controls natively into process
  - Deployments of ARM & ALZ Bicep modules require access at tenant root (/) scope
  - ALZ accelerators deploy ARM templates within the Portal experience
    - Pre-provisioned code with tools & controls for security baseline
  - Bicep templates offer the same capabilities as ARM templates
    - Define infrastructure through specified parameters / variables / expressions / modules
      - To deliver ALZ conceptual architecture using modular approach, use ALZ Bicep Modules

- **Create and Configure an Azure Key Vault**
  - What can be stored in a Key vault, eh?
    - Keys
      - "Think key pairs"
    - Secrets
      - Simple secrets e.g. decryption passwords
    - Certificates
      - Enterprise certificate management

- **Recommend When to Use a Dedicated HSM**
  - Only supported by Standard SKU Key Vault
    - _Not_ by basic SKU
  - Can be used to support the following
    - FIPS 140-2 Level-3 compliance
      - E.g. for government organisations
    - Single tenancy of cryptographic storage device
    - Full admin control + sole access to device for admin purposes
    - High application performance
    - Unique cloud-based offerings
  - Best for "lift & shift" scenarios that require direct & sole access to HSM devices
    - _Not fit_ for scenarios such as MS cloud services that support encryption with customer-managed keys
      - Where these keys are not integrated with Dedicated HSM

- **Configure Access to Azure Key Vault**
  - Vault access policies
    - ARM Portal
      - Configure under "Principal" pane
    - Azure CLI
      - `az keyvault set-policy`
    - Azure PowerShell
      - `Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy`
  - RBAC
    - One place to manage all permissions across all Key Vault instances
    - Can set permissions at different scope levels
      - Management group / subscription / resource group / resource
    - Can have separate permissions for individual keys / secrets / certificates

- **Manage Certificates, Secrets, and Keys**
  - Manage certificates
    - X.509 certificate management
      - Key vault policy can manage certificate _lifecycle_
        - Can provide contact information for _notifications_
  - Manage secrets
    - Granular isolation of secrets
    - Can store credential information a secret (value)
    - Rotate secrets <= 60 days (see below)
    - Monitor access via Key Vault logging
  - Manage keys
    - Encryption keys
      - Platform-managed _or_ customer-managed
      - Azure Key Vault / Dedicated HSM
        - Manage keys in t' cloud
          - Different use cases
            - E.g. FIPS compliance mandates use of a Dedicated HSM

- **Configure Key Rotation**
  - Can update keys and secrets _without affecting (your) application_
  - Use the following approaches
    - As part of a manual process
    - Programmatically with REST API
    - With an Azure Automation script

- **Configure Backup and Recovery of Secrets, Certificates, and Keys**
  - "Can't backup an entire Key Vault"
    - So have to backup the different entities as required
  - Soft delete
    - "The recycle bin for Key Vault"

## 4.2 Manage Security Posture by Using Microsoft Defender for Cloud

- **Identify and Remediate Security Risks by Using MS Defender for Cloud Secure Score and Inventory**
  - "There's the free version and the paid-for version"
    - Free version offers the following stuff out-the-box
