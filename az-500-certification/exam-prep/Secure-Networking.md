## 2.1 Plan and Implement Security for Virtual Networks

- **Plan and implement Network Security Groups (NSG) and Application Security Groups (ASG)**
  - NSG
    - Layer 4 (packet filter)
    - Any number of rules (subject to subscription limits)
    - Security rule: source / destination / port / protocol
    - Rules evaluated based on five-tuple information
      - 1 - Source
      - 2 - Source port
      - 3 - Destination
      - 4 - Destination port
      - 5 - Protocol
    - NOTE: The default (ARM-generated) rules are applied last
      - These rules cannot be modified
    - Modifying an NSG rule only impacts new connections
  - ASG
    - "A bucket of vNICs"
      - Used to make rules inside NSGs
    - Reuse security policy at scale
      - Without manual maintenance of IP addresses
        - Rules that specify ASG as source or destination are only applied to vNICs that are members of the ASG
    - ASGs have limitations
      - E.g. all vNICS assigned to an ASG must exist in the same vNet as the first vNIC added to that ASG

- **Plan and Implement User-Defined Routes (UDRs)**
  - ARM creates system routes ("behind the scenes")
  - Customers create UDRs which supersede system routes
    - Can specify the following next hops in a UDR
      - Virtual appliance
      - Virtual network gateway
      - Virtual network
      - Internet
      - None
    - NOTE: Cannot specify VNet peering or Virtual Network Service Endpoint as next hop

- **Plan and Implement VNet Peering or VPN Gateway**
  - A VNet peering is between regions
    - A _global VNet peering_ is used for more than one region
  - VNet peering is faster to set up
    - A VPN gateway takes ~ 45 mins
  - A VNet peering is a private connection
  - A VPN gateway gives an _encrypted connection_
    - NOTE: Use in compliance contexts

- **Plan and Implement Virtual WAN including Secured Virtual Hub**
  - Use vWAN to connect to resources in Azure over an IPsec / IKE v1 / IKE v2 VPN connection

- **Secure VPN Connectivity including Point-to-Site and Site-to-Site**
  - Secure hybrid access through Azure AD Application Proxy
    - Can use site-to-site VPN
      - Or Express Route
        - Or point-to-site VPN
  - Secure hybrid access through Azure AD partner integrations
    - Pre-built solutions that support conditional access policies per application
      - E.g. Kemp / Strata
    - On-premises apps authenticate against AAD

- **Configure Firewall Settings on PaaS Resources**
  - Azure native
    - Azure Firewall
      - Layer 7 application filter
    - Web Application Firewall (WAF) in Application Gateway
      - OWASP Top Ten
  - Third party
    - E.g. next generation firewall (NGFW)
  - Express Route can be terminated outside firewall
    - or inside firewall (recommended)

- **Monitor Network Security by Using Network Watcher including NSG Flow Logging**
  - Network Watcher = a network monitoring tool
    - VPN traffic
    - Packet sniffing
    - Next hop (kinda like traceroute)
    - Connectivity (kinda like ping)
  - NSG flow logs = how the traffic is being processed (or not) by the rules in an NSG

## 2.2 Plan and Implement Security for Private Access to Azure Resources

- **Plan and Implement VNet Service Endpoints**
  - "Make services a known entity on a network"
  - Traffic moves across the Azure backbone
    - VNet 1 --> VNet 2
  - NOTE: "The entire Azure service"
    - E.g. applies to _all_ your Azure SQL instances
  - Controllable via _service endpoint policy_

- **Plan and Implement Private Endpoints**
  - NOTE: Use for single instances of a service
    - E.g. private endpoint for SQL
      - Gives a database a private IP on its VNet
        - Then connect to the database via _Private Link_

- **Plan and Implement Private Link Services**
  - REVISE: The steps required to configure an application to run behind a standard Load Balancer then create a Private Link Service and attach it to the LB's front-end IP configuration...

- **Plan and Implement Network Integration for Azure App Service and Azure Functions**
  - Gateway-required VNet integration
    - For traffic to other regions
      - Versus _regional VNet integration_
        - Traffic in the same region

- **Plan and Implement Network security Configurations for App Service Environment (ASE)**
  - REVISE: What is the use case(s) for an ASE?

- **Plan and Implement Network Security Configurations for Azure SQL Managed Instance**
  - REVISE: Confirm the components that are required

## 2.3 Plan and Implement Security for Public Access to Azure Resources

- **Plan and Implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) to Applications including Azure App Service and API Management**
  - TLS protects applications with the following Good Stuff
    - Strong authentication
    - Message privacy and integrity
    - Algorithm flexibility
    - Ease of deployment and use
    - Interoperability between systems
    - Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

- **Plan, Implement, and Manage Azure Firewall including Azure Firewall Manager and Firewall Policies**
  - What can Azure Firewall do?
    - Application FQDN filtering rules
    - Network traffic filtering rules
    - FQDN tags
    - Outbound SNAT
    - Inbound DNAT support
    - NOTE: Installs on a separate firewall subnet
    - Static public IP address
    - Forced tunnelling
      - Push all incoming Internet traffic to a specific next hop
        - E.g. an on-premises device
      - NOTE: This requires the use of UDRs

- **Plan and Implement Azure Application Gateway**
  - Layer 7
  - Regionally based
    - An AGW can only operate per (single) region
  - Can route traffic to the following
    - Virtual Machines
    - On-premises hosts
    - Virtual Machine Scales Sets (VMSS)
    - Azure App Service
    - External app services
  - Can include Web Application Firewall (WAF)
    - Recommended
      - But customers are free to use other third party tools

- **Plan and Implement Azure Front Door including Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
  - NOTE: Layer 7 _global_ routing
    - Can span regions
  - REVISE: What is use case(s)?

- **Plan and Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
  - OWASP Core Rule Sets 3.1 / 3.0 / 2.29
    - "OWASP Top Ten"
  - NOTE: Global WAF policy
  - Supports the following services
    - Azure Front Door
    - Application Gateway
    - CDN (in preview)

- **Recommend When to Use Azure DDoS Protection Standard**
  - Basic service tier is FOC to all customers
    - On an individual subscription basis
  - Standard tier is intended for _multiple subscriptions_
    - Can be managed via _policies_
      - This results in improved visibility across more than one subscription
