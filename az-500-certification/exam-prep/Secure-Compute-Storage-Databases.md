## 3.1 Plan and Implement Advanced Security for Compute

- **Plan and Implement Remote Access to Public Endpoints Including Azure Bastion**
  - The benefits of Azure Bastions service
    - Remote session over TLS
    - Firewall traversal for RDP / SSH
    - No public IP required for the target VM
  - Bastion is available in two SKUs
    - Basic
    - Standard
  - Avoid exposing RDP / SSH ports over t' Internet
    - Deploy bastion hosts on the public side of the perimeter network
  - Bastion understands VNet peering!

- **Configure Network Isolation for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
  - Cluster isolation can be configured in two ways
    - 1 - Logical isolation
      - High pod density
      - Additional security features to block exploits
        - E.g. Kubernetes RBAC for nodes
      - Only trust hypervisor when running hostile multi-tenant workloads
    - 2 - Physical isolation
      - Low pod density
      - Adds _management and financial overhead_
        - Need to run more AKS hosts
      - Use _only_ for hostile multi-tenant workloads
        - For other scenarios, it's recommended to use logical isolation

- **Secure and Monitor AKS**
  - Use Microsoft Defender for Containers to protect AKS
    - Environment hardening
      - Asses cluster continuously
        - Visibility into misconfigurations
        - Guidelines to help mitigate identified threats
  - Vulnerability assessment
    - Vulnerability assessment & management tools are stored in Azure Container Registries (ACRs) & run in AKS
  - Run-time threat protection for nodes & clusters
    - Threat protection for clusters & Linux nodes
      - Generate security alerts for suspicious activities

- **Configure Authentication for AKS**
  - AAD authentication for AKS clusters with OpenID Connect
  - AKS-managed AAD Integration on existing Kubernetes RBAC-enabled clusters
  - Upgrade to _AKS-managed AAD Integration_ if using legacy AAD integration
  - Use _kubelogin_ to access cluster
    - Non-interactive service principal sign-in
  - Use Conditional Access to control access whilst integrating AAD with AKS cluster
  - Use PIM for JIT requests for cluster access control
  - There are limitations!
    - Think in terms of "design decisions"
      - You can disable AKS-managed AAD Integration
      - You can't change an AKS-managed AAD cluster to legacy AAD
      - AKS-managed AAD integration does not support clusters that are not Kubernetes RBAC-enabled

- **Configure Security Monitoring for Azure Container Instances (ACIs)**
  - Azure Monitor provides the following metrics for container groups & individual containers
    - CPU usage (millicores)
    - Memory usage (bytes)
    - Network bytes received (per sec)
    - Network bytes transmitted (per sec)
  - Gather Azure Monitor metrics using the following methods
    - ARM Portal
      - Visit "Overview" page for the container group
    - Azure CLI
      - Get the container group ID via `az container show`
  - NOTE: Currently Azure Monitor metrics are only available for Linux containers

- **Configure Security Monitoring for Azure Container Apps (ACAs)**
  - Monitor & scan container images
    - IMPORTANT: Solutions to scan container images in a private registry (e.g. ACR) & identify potential vulnerabilities
      - Solutions include MS Defender for Cloud integrated Qualys scanner
        - Also Twistlock
          - And Aqua Security
  - Monitor container activity & access
    - To identify suspicious or malicious activity
      - Via _continuous monitoring_
    - Use container monitoring solutions provided by Azure
      - E.g. Container Insights
  - Monitor container resource activity
    - E.g. files & other resources accessed by containers
    - Use Azure Monitor to collect metrics / activity logs / diagnostic logs
    - Review metrics for performance statistics for different resources
      - And for the OS inside the VM
        - TODO: Check what this means

- **Manage Access to ACR**
  - What is ACR?
    - A Docker registry service
    - Private & hosted in Azure
    - Build - store - manage images
    - Push & pull with Docker CLI or Azure CLI
  - Access with AAD
  - Use RBAC to assign permissions
  - Automate using Azure DevOps

- **Configure Disk Encryption Including Azure Disk Encryption (ADE), Encryption as Host, and Confidential Disk Encryption**
  - "Everything at rest in Azure is encrypted in one way or another"
    - This is also known as "Storage Service Encryption (SSE)"
  - ADE sits on top of SSE
    - It encrypts the OS
      - BitLocker for Windows
      - dm-crypt for Linux
  - Keys / secrets can be stored in customer Key vault & retrieved by VM e.g. on boot

- **Recommend Security Configurations for Azure API Management**
  - "What APIs are allowed to use our environments?"
  - Use the Azure security baseline for API management
    - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline>
      - Network Security
        - NS-1
        - NS-2
      - Identity Management
        - IM-1
        - IM-3
      - Privileged Access
        - PA-1
        - PA-7
      - Data Protection
        - DP-1
        - DP-2
      - Asset Management
        - AM-2
      - Logging & Threat Detection
        - LT-1
        - LT-4
      - Backup & Recovery
        - BR-1

## 3.2 Plan and Implement Security for Storage

- **Configure Access Control forStorage accounts**
  - "Know this table!"
    - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/authorize-data-access>
      - Just need to know Azure Blobs /  Azure Files (SMB) / Azure Files (REST)
        - The latter is the service for API access
  - "How do we access our different storage environments?"
    - Access & authorisation
      - Can include anonymous
        - NOTE: Anonymous for Blobs only
  - "Every storage request must be authorised!"
  - Storage Account Key versus Shared Access Signature
    - SAK for everything in a SA
    - SAS for a specific resource within an SA

- **Manage Lifecycle for Storage Account Access Keys**
  - Management plane
    - "Functional... for building stuff"
      - Creating resources in Azure
  - Data plane
    - Access things inside resources directly when storage related
      - NOTE: Apps require this level of access to work with SA Keys

- **Select and Configure an Appropriate Method for Access to Azure Files**
  - Identity-based authentication for Windows file shares over SMB via the following methods
    - NOTE: Only one method allowed per storage account
      - On-premises AD DS authentication
        - On-premises AD DS-joined or AAD DS-joined
      - AAD DS Authentication
        - Cloud-based AAD DS-joined Windows VMs
      - AAD Kerberos for hybrid identities
        - Via the Internet from hybrid AAD-joined VMs

- **Select and Configure an Appropriate Method for Access to Azure Blob Storage**
  - Ensure (you have) specific permissions to authorise the access
  - Authenticate with account access key _or_ AAD account
    - Can switch method when uploading blob to SA
      - When using the ARM Portal, that is

- **Select and Configure an Appropriate Method for Access to Azure Tables**
  - "Think of (Azure Tables as) no SQL database integration points"
  - Access to a table is a two step process
    - 1 - Identity authenticated
      - OAuth 2.0 token returned
    - 2 - Token passed to Tables service
      - Used to authorise the access
  - Use Azure built-in roles
    - Or define custom roles to access table data
  - Resource scope
        - Recommended to grant only the narrowest possible scope
  - Built-in roles include
    - Storage Table Data Contributor
    - Storage Table Data Reader
  - NOTE: Only roles explicitly defined for data access will allow an SPN to access table data

- **Select and configure an Appropriate method for Access to Azure Queues**
  - Authenticate with account access key _or_ AAD user account
    - NOTE: AAD user account (also) covers SPNs & Managed Identities

- **Select and Configure Appropriate Methods for Protecting Against Data Security Threats**
  - Basic data protection
    - Enable container soft delete
    - Save blob state at regular intervals
    - Use ARM lock on SA to protect against deletion / configuration changes
  - Data protection options in Azure storage
    - ARM lock
    - Container soft delete
    - Immutability policy on container
    - Point-in-time restore
    - Immutability policy on blob version
    - Blob versioning
    - Blob snapshot
    - Blob soft delete
    - Roll-your-own solution for copying data to a second SA

- **Configure Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**
  - Bring your own custom-managed key
    - Versus using a Microsoft-managed key
  - A customer-managed key must be stored in Azure Key Vault!

## 3.3 Plan and Implement Security for Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance

- **Enable Database Authentication by Using Azure Active Directory, Part of Microsoft Entra**
  - There's SQL Authentication (local username + password)
  - And then there's AAD authentication
    - To use as an alternative to SQL authentication
  - Helps stop proliferation of users IDs across database servers
  - Helps to support SSO
  - Allows password rotation in a single place
  - Customers can manage database permissions using external (AAD) groups

- **Enable Database Auditing**
  - Retain audit trail of selected events
  - Report on database activity & analyse results
  - Configure policies for server _or_ per database
  - Configure audit log destination
  - NOTE: A new server policy applies to all existing & newly created databases

- **Plan and Implement Dynamic Data Masking**
  - Masks sensitive data for non-privileged users
    - E.g. credit card numbers / telephone numbers
      - Only see the last four digits
  - Administrators are excluded
    - Other exclusions can be added
  - Rules are used to apply the masking logic
    - Several formats are available
